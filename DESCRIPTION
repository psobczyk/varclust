Description: Package varclust performs clustering of variables, according
  to a probabilistic model, which assumes that each variable is part of a 
  cluster, that lies in a low dimensional subspace. Segmentation of variables, 
  number of clusters and their dimensions are selected based on the appropriate 
  implementation of the Bayesian Information Criterion.
