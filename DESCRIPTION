Description: Package varclust performs clustering of quantitative variables,
    assuming that clusters lie in low-dimensional subspaces. Segmentation of
    variables, number of clusters and their dimensions are selected based on
    BIC. Candidate models are identified based on many runs of K-means
    algorithm with different random initializations of cluser centers.
