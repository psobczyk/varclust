\title{Choses a subspace for a variable}
\usage{
choose.cluster.BIC(variable, pcas, number.clusters,
  show.warnings = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{variable}{A variable to be assigned.}

\item{pcas}{Orthogonal basis for each of the subspaces.}

\item{number.clusters}{Number of subspaces (clusters).}

\item{show.warnings}{A boolean - if set to TRUE all warnings are displayed, default value is FALSE.}
}
\value{
index Number of most similar subspace to variable.
}
\description{
Selects a subspace closest to a given variable. To select the subspace, the method 
considers (for every subspace) a subset of its principal components and tries 
to fit a linear model with the variable as the response. Then the method chooses 
the subspace for which the value of BIC was the highest.
